# TypeScript Advanced Features Review

Comprehensive review and practice implementation of key advanced features in TypeScript. This repository covers concepts essential for writing robust, scalable, and type-safe applications, aligning with knowledge required for advanced TypeScript certification and exams.

---

## 🎯 Key Topics Covered

-  **Generics:**
   -  Usage and application in functions to create reusable components.
-  **Type Operations (Type Assertion):**
   -  Understanding the purpose of the `as` keyword for explicitly providing type information to the TypeScript compiler.
-  **Union Types:**
   -  Defining flexible types that can hold the value of one of multiple specific types (e.g., `string | number`).
-  **Decorators:**
   -  Implementing and understanding Class Decorators (receiving the class definition).
   -  Decorator Factories (functions that return a decorator).
   -  Decorator Composition (the process of combining multiple decorators).
-  **Type Constraints:**
   -  Using constraints in Generics (`<T extends SomeType>`) to ensure the allowed types possess some minimum required structure or information.
